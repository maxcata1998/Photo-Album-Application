Design idea:

Model:
  Use a Reader class to handle txt file to return a model(an AblumSystem).
  handle an album as a system and regard a page as a canvas. Every takeSnapshot will create a
snapshot objet, and also every snapshot has their own ID, description, and a list of shape cloned
from current canvas.
  Changes: At beginning, I uses string to store all snapshot, and this time I found it is more useful
to regard every snapshot as a object, so that I can call method to get the ID, Description, and a list
of shapes.

View:
  Use a swingWindow class to handle graphical view. The swing window has three parts. One part to show
description, the center part to show the shapes according the snapshots in a model, and the bottom
part adds four buttons to control the shapes. It will paint the first snapshot of the model, and use
resetPanel function to repaint the shape.
  Use a webView class to create the html file for the model.

Controller:
  Use a controller class to control the buttons in the swingWindow. When clicking one button, it will
execute corresponding content. I use an int "count" to control the order of snapshots.

Main:
  use the main file to handle the command line and create new view and controller according to command.
